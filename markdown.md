# An Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a way of annotating text to describe document structure
and style. This is done in such a manner that a script can turn the
document into HTML.

## Section

For example, starting a line with ```#``` marks that line as a section
title, and the content between that and the next line starting with a
single ```#``` as a section. For example, the title of this section is
formatted as:

```Markdown

	# An Introduction to Markdown
```

Similarly, starting a line with ```##``` marks a subsection, ```###```
marks a subsubsection, and so on, up to ```######```
